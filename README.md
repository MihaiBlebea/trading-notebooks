## Important numbers

- Current Ratio - should be greater than 1.5 - it compares the current assets against the current liabilities

- Price / Book Ratio (P/B) - should be < 3 - shows the difference between the market value of a company and its current value

- PEG Ratio - should be < 1 (means great) or < 3 (means good) - PEG less than one is considered undervalued, as the price is low compared to the company's expected earnings growth. Like P/E but including the growth factor.

- Dividends Payout - should be < 60% (0.6) - highlights if the company will be able to pay its dividends to shareholders.
